# topicModeling
Extract important topics from reviews of a restaurant
We analyse the reviews written in Yelp for the restaurant 'ABC Kitchen' in New York City using LDA in an effort to do topic modeling. In other words, we use LDA to extract most common topics across the reviews. Doing so will help us in determining how the patrons are either liking or disliking the restaurant.
